# Activation Analysis

The experiments in this folder are specific to our ResNet architecture. The goal was to analyze the activations of the model, occurring when feeding training/validation data of Tiny ImageNet.

Analyze is in particular: 
* Visualization of the individual channels
* Principal component analysis (PCA), with the goal of understanding the impact that the removal of _n_ dimensions has at a given layer
