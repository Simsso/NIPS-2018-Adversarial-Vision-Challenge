# Linear Combination Experiments

This module package contains functionality for three different things:
 * training a CNN on MNISt and storing the weights (+ logging to TensorBoard)
 * loading the weights and analyzing the classification of linear combinations between inputs
 * loading the weights and computing an adversarial example using FGSM
